# Laser source properties:
#   wavelength:  central wavelength, in nm
#   bandwidth:   bandwidth (1-sigma), in nm
#   instability: long-term wavelength instability (1-sigma), in nm
#   intensity:   observed total intensity at sensor, in counts/s
#   imbalance:   power inconsistency between two arms
# Laser interference sensing model:
#   d_i = G_i * I_i + b_i, for i = 0,1,2,3.
#   d_0, d_1, d_2 and d_3 are ABCD samplings at four different phases.
#   G_i and b_i are gain factor and additive background correspondingly.
# ToF sensor properties:
#   precision:  ranging precision (1-sigma), in mm.
